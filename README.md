# Fifa-20

Problem Statement

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.
Task 2:- Explore football skills and cluster football players based on their attributes.
Task3:- Explore the data and attempt all the below asked questions in a
step by step manner:
● Prepare a rank ordered list of top 10 countries with most players. Which
countries are producing the most footballers that play at this level?
● Plot the distribution of overall rating vs. age of players. Interpret what is the
age after which a player stops improving?
● Which type of offensive players tends to get paid the most: the striker, the
right-winger, or the left-winger?

Dataset Link:

FIFA 20 Football is arguably the most popular sport in the world and FIFA is the most
popular football (soccer) simulation game by Electronic Arts (EA Sports).
The dataset provided includes the players data for the Career Mode from FIFA 15 to
FIFA 20 (&quot;players_20.csv&quot;). The data allows multiple comparisons of the same
players across the last 6 versions of the videogame.
Some ideas of possible analysis:
● Historical comparison between Messi and Ronaldo (what skill attributes
changed the most during time - compared to real-life stats);
● Ideal budget to create a competitive team (at the level of top n teams in
Europe) and at which point the budget does not allow to buy significantly
better players for the 11-men lineup. An extra is the same comparison with
the Potential attribute for the lineup instead of the Overall attribute;

● Sample analysis of top n% players (e.g. top 5% of the player) to see if some
important attributes such as Agility or BallControl or Strength have been
popular or not across the FIFA versions. An example would be seeing that
the top 5% players of FIFA 20 are faster (higher Acceleration and Agility)
compared to FIFA 15. The trend of attributes is also an important indication
of how some attributes are necessary for players to win games (a version
with more top 5% players with high BallControl stats would indicate that the
game is more focused on the technique rather than the physical aspect).
